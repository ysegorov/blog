# About

I am Yuri Egorov, web developer currently living in Moscow, Russia.

## Summary

I think of myself as a [generalist][generalist].
I try to use simple solutions when possible to have control over project.
I prefer to be focused on something. It can be a project, a library or anything
else. This way I can be sure I'll be effective in my work.

In my day-to-day work I am using **python** for backend tasks
and **javascript** for frontend tasks and can write **HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS**
when it's ne—Åessary.

My basic toolchain consists of [Django][django] / [Tornado][tornado] /
[Flask][flask] web frameworks for backend tasks.
I have experience working with **jython** for some specific tasks.

For frontend tasks I'm exploring functional programming and find it very
interesting. Currently I am working on [@yagni-js][yagni-js] - several
open-sourced (unlicensed) **javascript** libraries, made with **functional**
and **stateless** mantras in mind.

Working for [Chtd][chtd] I've created frontend js **bundler** using **nodejs**.

I've worked with **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** and in case I would
have to pick one [PostgreSQL][postgresql] will be my choice.
[Redis][redis] is my choice of fast in-memory storage.

I write code in **vim** and prefer to use **git** when possible.

I run **Linux** on my desktop since 2003.
Since 2012 I am running ArchLinux due to its awesome [philosophy][archlinux].
Before Arch I was using Red Hat and Gentoo and besides I have experience
working with Ubuntu and RedHat/CentOS.
I can deploy and manage Linux server and can configure network services when
needed (*dns, web, email* and *others*).
I have experience working (which means deployment and everyday usage) with
[jenkins][jenkins], [sentry][sentry] and worked with **AWS**, **Digital Ocean**
and **Linode**.
From time to time I'm using [ansible][ansible] and [vagrant][vagrant].


Language
--------

My native language is Russian.
I've studied English more then ten years ago and from time to time used it
(not too often really).
I'll do my best while blogging in English.


Status
------

Currently I am employed but I am still open for job offers.
I'm looking for an interesting job to get my mind and my hands
busy all day long.

You can contact me by sending email to *ysegorov at gmail.com*.

My CV is available [here][cv].
