# Static Blog Generator

This is a short introduction to [wt][1] - library I've made for my personal
use.

It is pretty young and it lacks some features I'd like it to have but it
works pretty good for me.

So, this is [yet][2] [another][3] [static][4] [site][5]/[blog][6]
[generator][7]. Yes. One more.

Some time ago I thought it would be great to build something for my own use. I
have several ideas and this is the first one named **wt**.
I know that **wt** is a name for executable from [WiredTiger][8]
distribution but I think it's ok. This library is not expected to be installed
system-wide, it should be used within virtual environment.
And luckily the name was free on [pypi][9].

The library requires **python 3** and have the following features (citing from
[readme][10]):

- [markdown][markdown] for content
- [yaml][yaml] for configuration
- [jinja2][jinja2] for templating
- [atom][atom] for feed
- [aiohttp][aiohttp] for development server
- only two types of content - **page** and **post**
- content metadata lives in configuration file
- have sensible defaults for content sources
- no python coding needed to work with

At the moment I've used it in a couple of projects.

The first one is this blog ([blog source code][11]) and another one
is the [tolsha.ru site][tolsha] (in Russian) I've created for my elder
brother who makes [pottery][13] and [they][14] [are][15] [amazing][16]
([site source code][12]).

These two sites are pretty different in nature but [wt][1] works very well for
both.

I'll keep this library moving forward adding more features and refactoring
some internals for a better code.

The next project I have plans for is **rss reader** and there is a big chance
I'll build it using [Elixir][elixir]/[Phoenix][phoenix].
