# Zola

I've decided to switch from [wt][wt] (which is archived now) to [zola][zola] to
manage this blog.

`wt` worked quite well for me but it requires time to manage it and to
develop it further (and I was not happy with `yaml`).

There are a lot of alternatives in this area and by occasion I've met
[zola][zola]. Luckily, it has most of the features I was using with [wt][wt]
(actually, it was the reason to switch to `zola` and to archive `wt`).

It took some time to understand the way [zola][zola] works - mostly to convert
templates from [jinja][jinja] to [tera][tera] and to update front-matter
from [yaml][yaml] to [toml][toml] format within markdown files.

I was hit by just one issue while converting this blog from `wt` to `zola`.

It was not clear to me that there is no need to apply `markdown` filter to
content in templates as it was applied implicitly. Applying it for a second
time breaks syntax highlighting formatting which led me to a thought that I
can't use `zola`.

Happily, I've looked through the `zola's` issues and found [this
one][zola-markdown-issue]. There is no need to apply `markdown` filter to
content in templates. Yay. Perfect.

Let's see how it will work for me.

Stay tuned and take care of you and your family.
