# WT documentation

<div class="note">

**Update.** `wt` library has been moved to archive, no plans to develop it further.

</div>

This is just a few words about [wt][wt] documentation.

It's ~~available online~~ and covers almost all **`wt`** features.

And it was built using [wt][wt]. Documentation sources are available in
the [wt][wt] repository under `docs/` folder.

There was [minor issue][baseurl-issue] with deployment though.

~~The documentation is hosted using [GitHub pages for projects][ghp] and it's
served under *baseurl* (**`/wt-docs/`** in my case)~~. I was not aware of this
requirement while developing [wt][wt] so internally it's not supported. This
means there is a difference between local links in *development* mode and in
*build* mode which can lead to broken local links in *build* mode.

I've solved the problem but I'm not sure I like the
solution. There must be a better way to handle *baseurl* (this issue was
solved in [wt][wt] later).
