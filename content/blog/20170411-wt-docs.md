# WT documentation

This is just a few words about [wt][wt] documentation.

It's available [online][wt-docs] and covers almost all **`wt`** features.

And it was built using [wt][wt]. Documentation sources are available on
[github][wt-docs-sources].

There was [minor issue][baseurl-issue] with deployment though.

The documentation is hosted using [GitHub pages for projects][ghp] and it's
served under *baseurl* (**`/wt-docs/`** in my case). I was not aware of this
requirement while developing [wt][wt] so internally it's not supported. This
means there is a difference between local links in *development* mode and in
*build* mode which can lead to broken local links in *build* mode.

[This commit][baseurl-commit] solves the problem but I'm not sure I like the
solution. There must be a better way to handle *baseurl*.
