# Jukoro 0.1.2 release

<div class="note">

**Update.** This library has been moved to archive, no plans to develop it further.

</div>

It happened - first public release of [Jukoro][jukoro] (not on PyPi but still).

It is an experiment and I'll do my best working on it.

## Features highlight (PostgreSQL-focused)

- unified tables structure in PostgreSQL storing data in a single per
  table [jsonb][jsonb] field
- out-of-the-box way to keep historical data in tables
- out-of-the-box support for ``psycopg2`` named cursors
- single per-database sequence generator for objects identifiers
- out-of-the-box support for created/updated/deleted timestamps
- indices and constraints support for data stored in [jsonb][jsonb] field
- connection to PostgreSQL always operate with timestamps in UTC
- PostgreSQL schema support
- way to introspect current database state
- way to prepare sql queries to synchronize database state and entities
  (models) declarations (queries to create missed tables/indices/constraints
  and to drop orphaned tables/indices/constraints)
- separation of concerns to work with PostgreSQL (explicit ways to work with
  pool/connection/transaction/results,
  to describe entities (models in terms of Django's ORM),
  to introspect database,
  to create customized sql queries)
