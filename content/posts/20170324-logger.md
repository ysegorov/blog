# Logger service using epoll - Part 1

<div class="note" markdown="1">
There is a [continuation][part2] of this post.
</div>

Suppose we have a number of microservices and we need some way to easily handle
logging from all of them.

[Graylog][graylog] might be a good choice but in case you don't
need such a full-featured solution self-made logging service can serve you well.

Python's [logging][1] facility has almost everything we need for this providing
[SocketHandler][2] to send log records to a network socket. The missed part is
actual logging service which will be able to receive and save those records.
[Logging Cookbook][3] contains [basic implementation][4] of such a service
which is good for a quick start.

I was experimenting with [curio][curio] as an engine for such a service and it
worked pretty well and certainly might be a good choice for this task. The only
thing forced me to look for another solution was it's Python 3 dependency. All
microservices I need logging service for are using Python 2 and I'd like
it to use the very same python.

So, after a bit more experiments I came up with **edge-triggered epoll-based**
solution which is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.
The code for the service is available [here][5].

It took some time to understand [epoll][epoll] mechanics and [this article][6]
by Scot Doyle helped a lot. My local test confirms service is pretty stable and
properly handle incoming logging records.

[Code in gist][5] is rather generic and I'm going to add some features, but
they won't be published there, sorry for that:

- use some *magic* number in message header as a simple measure to prevent
  unknown clients from spamming (even though the service will listen on
  localhost)
- enforce message size limits
- store logging records in database

Another part of this story is [SocketHandler][2] which has a feature I'd like
to remove - [createSocket][7] method implemets exponential back-off algorithm
which I just don't need. During my tests intentionally broken (just for tests)
connection to logging service leads to logging records being missed.

To be clear with the problem. Suppose we have a server and a microservice.
Everything works as expected and is in good shape. Some time later we need to
update the code for logging service and restart it. Using [SocketHandler][2]
from python's standard library will force us to restart our microservice
because without this step we will be missing at least one or two logging
records from it (due to the way this handler works).

I wanted a way to automatically handle such a situation without user
intervention. So, below is a modified version of [SocketHandler][2]. Every time
it needs to handle a record it will try to connect to logging service to
guarantee message delivery. It uses [small trick][8] to detect socket state and
to re-establish connection when needed.

I'll put logging service and this handler in production next month. Stay tuned.
