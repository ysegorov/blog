# Stateless functional fun

I don't remember exactly the day I've came across [cleanjs][cleanjs] - eslint
configuration to help you write functional javascript code.
The first thought that came to my mind was "Is it possible to write javascript
in such a way?".

Time passed and one day I was reading [Elixir][Elixir] documentation about
[pipes][pipes]. And I've got another question that came to my mind - "How can
this concept be used in javascript?".

Let's answer these questions.
