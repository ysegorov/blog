# Meet Juvi


While working on a pet project I've created a small client-side library
responsible (mostly) for a View part in MV\* patterns and have named it
[juvi][juvi] (without any specific reason, just to have short name being
easy to remember).

It is young and unstable but still looked pretty good for me.

[Juvi][juvi] depends on another library - [proto-js][protojs] which is
a modified fork of Axel Rauschmayer's [code](https://github.com/rauschma/proto-js).
The [idea](http://www.2ality.com/2011/06/prototypes-as-classes.html) behind
of **proto-js** is very interesting and it's not clear to me why it's not as
popular as it should be.
Currently I'm thinking about embedding **proto-js** code to **juvi** due to the
fact it's small and it will be easier to manage **juvi**.

So, coming back to **juvi**.

Originally plan was to create something simple and extendable and to have the
following features included out-of-the-box:

- extendability (must be a way to extend view to keep code DRY and organized)
- unified way to render view
- unified way to attach event handlers to DOM
- unified way to declare, render and attach to DOM children views
- simple and reliable way to close view on its own and children views and
  free resources

There is almost no magic inside [view.js][1], just check the code (code can
speak, certainly).

Probably, the most interesting part is **handleEvent** method. Here is an
[article](http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/handleevent) describing the
technique.

And one more note about children views.

Children views must be described in view instance as:

```javascript
// code can be placed into init method

this.children = {
    $title: TitleView(somePropsObject),
    $items: this.items.map(function (it) { return ItemView.new(it); })
};

```

and DOM nodes as:

```javascript
// code should be placed into populateNodes method

var el = this.el,
    $ = this.$;         // NB. not a jQuery!

this.nodes = {
    $title: $('[data-title]', el),
    $items: $('[data-items]', el)
};

```


Having such a definitions view will automatically render all children views and
attach them to the specified DOM nodes:

- **this.children.$title** view will be attached to **this.nodes.$title** node
- **this.children.$items** views will be attached to **this.nodes.$items** node
  (keeping order)

There is no way to emit or listen for events per view because I'm trying to
keep events flow organized in a **Flux** way. Here is the [dispatcher.js](https://github.com/ysegorov/juvi/blob/develop/src/dispatcher.js)
- instance of [pubsub.js](https://github.com/ysegorov/juvi/blob/develop/src/pubsub.js).

And I almost forgot about this dependency - **Promise**. It's up to you to
pick the one and include it in your project.
Currently I'm using some parts of [core.js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)
library. Here is [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise)
polyfill suitable for **pubsub** too.

That's it.

The mantra stays the same.

**Become a creator, not a consumer.**

---------------

NB. I'm thinking about rewriting [jquery.dashboard](https://github.com/ysegorov/jquery.dashboard)
and [mg](https://bitbucket.org/ysegorov/mg/src) libraries using [Juvi][juvi].
