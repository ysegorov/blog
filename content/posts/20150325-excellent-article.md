# Excellent article


Really excellent [article][1] ([original][2] in Russian).

Yesterday I've summed up [my experience][3] working for [Chtd][chtd]
and I have one more thought to share.

It's just one more reason to minimize frameworks usage.

From my experience frameworks are a trap. You can safely use them for some time
but in case your project is evolving and you want to follow the evolution of
used frameworks you will find yourself spending time refactoring your code to
work with that exact framework.

Instead of developing your project's business logic you have to support
some framework code evolution.  
It sounds strange for me.  
I've faced this problem working for [Chtd][chtd] but I had no luck
explaining the problem to colleagues.

There is a way to use framework - just freeze it on a specific version but
that's another trap.

You will have to support framework at that specific
version on your own fixing bugs or adding missed functionality or backporting
or whatever. Do you really need it?

I think it's better to spend time focusing on your business logic.

To be a good developer you have to find your own way. Build something on
your own. Make mistakes. Fix them. Explore and share your knowledge.

Become a creator, not a consumer.
